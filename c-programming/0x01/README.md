Pseudocode
1. Assign a random integer in a variable n
2. If n is greater than 0

Task 1: C program that checks the last digits of a number and checks if it is greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 and not 0
Pseudocode
1. Assign a random number to a variable n
2. Determine the last digit of n to a variable in ld
3. If last digit of n is less than 0
	multiply by -1 and store in ld
4. If ld is greater than 5
	print "Last digit of n is ld and is greater than 5"
5. Else if ld is greater than 0 and less than 6
	print "Last digit of n is ld and is less than 6 and not 0"
6. Else
	print "Last digit of n is ld and is 0"
7. End
